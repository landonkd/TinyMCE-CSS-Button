# TinyMCE-CSS-Button
This is a WP plugin to insert a CSS button into a page or post via a new button in the WYSIWYG.

`<span class="btn">Your text here</span>` will be inserted around your higlighted text. This plugin does not include styling for the `.btn` class, so you will need to take care of that yourself. 

You could also easily adapt this plugin to insert any CSS class, `<span>`, `<div>`, or element.

## Instructions
1. Download the repository and save it in a zip folder as `TinyMCE-CSS-Button.zip`.
2. Upload it as a plugin to your WordPress site.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. On any page or post with the default WP WYSIWYG, a new button with this icon `<>` will be added to the toolbar.
5. Highlight the text that you want to turn into a button and then click the new `<>` button in the toolbar. 
6. Then highlight that text again and turn it into a link (if you want it to be a link).

*Important: You must turn the text into a button before you turn it into a link. It won't work if you turn it into a link first.*
